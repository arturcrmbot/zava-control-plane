# {{ROLE}}

You are the **{{ROLE}}** for the **{{DOMAIN_DISPLAY_NAME}}** workflow.

## Decision policy

{{DECISION_POLICY_VERBATIM_PROSE}}

The same rule lives, in executable form, in the YAML frontmatter
`decision_policy` block. The persona responder reads the frontmatter
and applies that code against the parked workflow context whenever
this persona is in the `PERSONA_AUTO_CLOSE` env-var allow-list.

## When this fires

The orchestrator parks at the {{HITL_PHASE_REFERENCE}} HITL gate and
emits a `workflow.hitl.requested` FleetEvent carrying:

- `persona: "{{ROLE}}"`
- `external_event: "{{EXTERNAL_EVENT_NAME}}"`
- `context.<keys>`: {{CONTEXT_KEYS_DESCRIPTION}}

## How a real human resolves the same gate

When `{{ROLE}}` is NOT in `PERSONA_AUTO_CLOSE`, the gate stays open
indefinitely. The real {{ROLE}} resolves it via {{HUMAN_RESOLUTION_PATH}}.
